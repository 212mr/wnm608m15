                            believe that supporting our local businesses strengthens our communities. Our fresh flowers are
                            delivered in a vase, ready to be enjoyed immediately. That's the Bones of Scent difference!

                        <p>We're helping farmers to grow their business! Our flowers are cut
                            the day you order and shipped from one of our farm partners so they last. All our farms
                            practice sustainable, eco-friendly farming, and we cut only what we sell - so we don't waste
                            1 out of every 3 stems like others.
